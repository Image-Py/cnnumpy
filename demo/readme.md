# Demos of numpy-cnn
Here we release some supported demos.

## CRAFT text detector
Demo for scene text detector with model [CRAFT](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch).
Run ```python main.py``` inside folder ```craft_text_detector```. 2 files (same level folder with ```main.py```) are needed (craft.txt, [craft.npy](https://github.com/Image-Py/numpy-cnn/releases/download/resource/craft.npy))
The detected result is shown as following:

## HED edge detector
Demo for edge detector with model HED. Run ```python main.py``` inside folder ```hed_edge_detector```. 2 files (same level folder with ```main.py```) are needed (hed.txt, [hed.npy](https://github.com/Image-Py/numpy-cnn/releases/download/resource/hed.npy))
The detected result is shown as following:
